# Create: Tempered Steel
This is an addon for Create that adds steel and bronze. 

This mod needs **[Create Big Cannons](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-big-cannons)** to work properly. This mod can be used as a replacement for steel from **[Create: Dreams & Desires](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-dreams-and-desires)**. In the future, it is planned to be compatible with **[Create Deco](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-deco)** and **[Ad Astra](https://modrinth.com/mod/ad-astra)**.

Now compatible with [**Farmer's Delight**](https://modrinth.com/mod/farmers-delight-refabricated)!

## Steel
Steel is used to create cannons, decorations and (in the future) some components for the Ad Astra mod

Steel can be made in a mixer from:
- ![Cast iron](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/efa5d8af7c6951501d37d01b33aa4a8fc61e3151.png) **4 cast iron ingots**
- ![Charcoal](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/096b759eea7007fffafba00a5b6e956d2836be97.png) **1 charcoal**
## Bronze
Bronze is used to create cannons and decorations

Bronze can be made in a mixer from:
- ![Copper ingot](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/5b4e902e805a891f698f91f12d2df3dbfe92b299.png) **3 copper ingots**
- ![Tin ingot](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/8f6bf526d38021bda90db0afbe11807af063be03.png) **1 tin ingot**
## Tin
Tin ore will now be generated underground. Tin is used to create bronze and decorations
