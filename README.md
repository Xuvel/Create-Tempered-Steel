# Create: Tempered Steel
This is an addon for Create that adds steel and bronze. This mod needs **[Create Big Cannons](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-big-cannons)** to work properly. This mod can be used as a replacement for steel from **[Create: Dreams & Desires](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-dreams-and-desires)**. In the future, it is planned to be compatible with **[Create Deco](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-deco)** and **[Ad Astra](https://modrinth.com/mod/ad-astra)**.
## Steel
Steel is used to create cannons, decorations and (in the future) some components for the Ad Astra mod
Steel can be made in a mixer from:
- ![Cast iron](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/efa5d8af7c6951501d37d01b33aa4a8fc61e3151.png) **4 cast iron ingots**
- ![Gunpowder](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/45585c5382a713efe66245f0c9c6074847aaf5d9.png) **1 gunpowder**
- ![Charcoal](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/096b759eea7007fffafba00a5b6e956d2836be97.png) **1 charcoal**
## Bronze
Bronze is used to create cannons and decorations
Bronze can be made in a mixer from:
- ![Copper ingot](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/5b4e902e805a891f698f91f12d2df3dbfe92b299.png) **3 copper ingots**
- ![Tin ingot](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/8f6bf526d38021bda90db0afbe11807af063be03.png) **1 tin ingots**
## Tin
Tin ore will now be generated underground. Tin is used to create bronze and decorations
## Used Textures
I use textures from **[Create: Dreams & Desires](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-dreams-and-desires)** and **[Create Metal](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-metal)** mods.
# Compatibility
**The mod is not compatible with [Create: Dreams & Desires](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-dreams-and-desires), [Ad Astra](https://modrinth.com/mod/ad-astra) and other mods that adds steel, bronze and tin. Compatibility with these mods is planned in the future.**
